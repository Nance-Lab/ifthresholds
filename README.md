# ifthresholds
IfThresholds is a Python package to score and assess standard threshold methods for fluorescent images. 

The threshold ranking will be based on manually labelled images and images produced by applying the standard threshold methods. IfThreshold guides researchers on which threshold method is the best one for their
images.
